# AdGuard Allow-List

This repository contains my personal **allowlist** for [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html).  
The goal is to keep **ad/tracker blocking strong** while ensuring essential work and productivity apps continue functioning.

## Purpose
AdGuard Home is very aggressive with blocking telemetry and tracking services.  
While this is great for privacy, some SaaS apps (Slack, Teams, Salesforce, Outlook, etc.) can break if critical domains are blocked.

This repo provides a **curated list of allowed domains** so these apps work normally without compromising the ad-blocking experience.

## Notes
- This allowlist is intentionally minimal — only domains required for core functionality are included.  
- If an app breaks, check AdGuard’s **Query Log** → add the blocked domain → commit back to this repo.  
- PRs or suggestions welcome if you see improvements.

Goal: Maintain **privacy + usability** balance — keep trackers out while ensuring workflows stay smooth.
